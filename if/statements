Newsquares is of indeterminate size 
Will add to Newsquares as long as the value of Squares is Orange.  
 
 
What is for loop? 
The for loop enables you to execute a code block multiple times. For example, you would use this if you would like to print out every element in a list. 
Let's try to use a for loop to print all the years presented in the list dates: 
 
So there are set limits the number of times a for loop will iterate 
 
for i in range(0, 8): 
    print(i) 
 
squares = ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue'] 
  
for i in range(0, 5): 
    print("Before square ", i, 'is',  squares[i]) first statement 
    squares[i] = 'white'      -- new statement 
    print("After square ", i, 'is',  squares[i])  2nd Statement 
 
Before square 0 is red  
After square 0 is white  
Before square 1 is yellow  
After square 1 is white  
Before square 2 is green  
After square 2 is white  
Before square 3 is purple  
After square 3 is white  
Before square 4 is blue  
After square 4 is white 
 
squares=['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue'] 
  
for i, square in enumerate(squares): 
    print(i, square) 
 
0 red  
1 yellow  
2 green  
3 purple  
4 blue 
 
dates = [1982, 1980, 1973, 2000] 
  
i = 0 
year = dates[0] 
  
while(year != 1973):     
    print(year) 
    i = i + 1 
    year = dates[i] 
print("It took ", i ,"repetitions to get out of loop.") 
 
1982  
1980  
It took 2 repetitions to get out of loop. 
 
To print out all the numbers in a range using a for loop 
for i in range(-5, 6): 
    print(i) 
-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 
 
Print the elements of the following list: Genres=[ 'rock', 'R&B', 'Soundtrack', 'R&B', 'soul', 'pop'] Make sure you follow Python conventions. 
 
Genres=[ 'rock', 'R&B', 'Soundtrack', 'R&B', 'soul', 'pop'] 
  
N = len(Genres) 
  
for i in range(N): 
    print(Genres[i]) 
 
rock R&B Soundtrack R&B soul pop 
 
PlayListRatings = [10, 9.5, 10, 8, 7.5, 5, 10, 10] 
  
for PlayListRating in PlayListRatings: 
    print(PlayListRating)

squares = ['orange', 'orange', 'purple', 'blue ', 'orange'] 
new_squares = [] 
  
i = 0 
  
while(i < len(squares) and squares[i] == 'orange'): 
    new_squares.append(squares[i]) 
    i = i + 1 
print(new_squares) 
 
['orange', 'orange'
